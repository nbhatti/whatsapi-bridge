# Infinite Loop Fixes - React "Maximum Update Depth Exceeded" Error

## 🚨 Problem
The application was experiencing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors caused by infinite re-render loops in React components. This typically happens when:

1. `useEffect` hooks trigger state updates that cause the same effect to run again
2. State update functions are called during render
3. Zustand store selectors cause unnecessary re-renders
4. Socket connections create multiple instances or reconnection loops

## ✅ Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **useEffect Dependency Array Issues**

**Problem:** In `RealtimeChatInterface.tsx`, the `loadDevices` function had `selectedDevices.length` in its dependency array, but the function itself called `setSelectedDevices`, creating an infinite loop.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Infinite Loop)
const loadDevices = useCallback(async () => {
  // ... code that calls setSelectedDevices
}, [selectedDevices.length, isConnected, subscribeToDevice]);

// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
const loadDevices = useCallback(async () => {
  setSelectedDevices(prevSelected => {
    // Use functional state update to avoid dependency
    // ... safe state update logic
    return newSelection;
  });
}, [isConnected, subscribeToDevice]); // Removed selectedDevices.length
```

### 2. **Socket Connection Management**

**Problem:** Multiple socket connections were being created due to improper cleanup and connection logic in `useSocket` hook.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Multiple Connections)
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoConnect && user && !socketRef.current?.connected && !isConnectingRef.current) {
    connect()
  }
  return cleanup
}, [user, autoConnect, connect]) // connect in dependencies caused loops

// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
useEffect(() => {
  if (autoConnect && user && !socketRef.current?.connected && !isConnectingRef.current) {
    connect()
  }
  return cleanup
}, [user, autoConnect]) // Removed connect from dependencies
```

**Also Added:**
- Proper socket cleanup before reconnecting
- Connection state guards to prevent multiple connection attempts
- Better logging for debugging connection issues

### 3. **Connection Status Update Loops**

**Problem:** Multiple components were updating connection status simultaneously, causing infinite loops.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Status Update Loops)
const handleConnectionStatusChange = (status) => {
  setConnectionStatus(status);
  console.log('Status changed to:', status);
};

// AFTER (✅ Fixed)
const handleConnectionStatusChange = (status) => {
  setConnectionStatus(prev => {
    if (prev !== status) {
      console.log('Status changed from', prev, 'to:', status);
      return status;
    }
    return prev; // Prevent unnecessary re-renders
  });
};
```

**Also Fixed:**
- Removed callback functions from useEffect dependencies
- Simplified SocketContext status management
- Added status change guards

### 4. **Zustand Store Selector Optimization**

**Problem:** Custom selector functions were causing unnecessary re-renders and "getSnapshot should be cached" warnings.

**Fix:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Custom Comparisons)
export const useConnectionStatus = () => useRealtimeStore(
  state => ({
    isConnected: state.isConnected,
    connectionStatus: state.connectionStatus
  }),
  (prev, next) => prev.isConnected === next.isConnected && prev.connectionStatus === next.connectionStatus
);

// AFTER (✅ Built-in Shallow Comparison)
import { shallow } from 'zustand/shallow';

export const useConnectionStatus = () => useRealtimeStore(
  state => ({
    isConnected: state.isConnected,
    connectionStatus: state.connectionStatus
  }),
  shallow
);
```

## 🛡️ Prevention Strategies

### 1. **useEffect Best Practices**
- ✅ Always use functional state updates when the new state depends on previous state
- ✅ Be careful with callback functions in dependency arrays
- ✅ Use `useCallback` for functions passed as dependencies
- ✅ Avoid including state setters in dependency arrays

### 2. **State Management**
- ✅ Use functional state updates: `setState(prev => newState)`
- ✅ Check if state actually changed before updating
- ✅ Use proper memoization for expensive computations

### 3. **Socket Connection Management**
- ✅ Implement connection guards to prevent multiple connections
- ✅ Always cleanup existing connections before creating new ones
- ✅ Use refs to track connection state
- ✅ Remove event listeners on cleanup

### 4. **Zustand Store Optimization**
- ✅ Use built-in `shallow` comparison instead of custom functions
- ✅ Avoid creating new objects/arrays in selectors without memoization
- ✅ Keep selectors simple and focused

### 5. **Debug Tools Created**
```typescript
// Debug helper for tracking re-renders
import { createRenderTracker } from '../utils/debug-helpers';

function MyComponent() {
  const tracker = createRenderTracker('MyComponent');
  tracker.trackRender(); // Logs render count and timing
  
  // Component logic...
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Fixes

After implementing all fixes:

1. ✅ App starts without infinite loop errors
2. ✅ Socket connections are established properly
3. ✅ No "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
4. ✅ Connection status updates work correctly
5. ✅ No Zustand "getSnapshot should be cached" warnings

## 📋 Quick Checklist for Future Prevention

When adding new features, check:

- [ ] Are useEffect dependency arrays correct?
- [ ] Are state updates using functional form when needed?
- [ ] Are callback functions properly memoized?
- [ ] Are socket connections properly managed?
- [ ] Are Zustand selectors optimized?
- [ ] Are there any state updates during render?
