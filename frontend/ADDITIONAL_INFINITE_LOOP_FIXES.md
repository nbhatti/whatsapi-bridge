# 🛠️ Additional Infinite Loop Fixes - Round 2

## 🚨 **New Problem Identified**
After the initial fixes, there was still a `useSyncExternalStore` error occurring in the Zustand store, specifically in the `useConnectionStatus` hook causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors.

## ⚡ **Root Cause Analysis**

The error was happening because:

1. **Object Recreation in Selectors**: The `useConnectionStatus` selector was creating a new object `{ isConnected, connectionStatus }` on every call, causing the shallow comparison to always fail
2. **Array Recreation in useActiveDevices**: Similar issue with filtered arrays being recreated every time
3. **Store Action in useEffect Dependencies**: `setConnectionStatus` was included in `useEffect` dependencies, creating feedback loops
4. **Unnecessary State Updates**: The `setConnectionStatus` action was updating state even when the status hadn't changed

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Fixed useConnectionStatus Selector**
**File:** `src/stores/realtime-store.ts`

**Problem:** Selector was creating new objects on every call, breaking shallow comparison.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Creates new object every time)
export const useConnectionStatus = () => useRealtimeStore(
  state => ({
    isConnected: state.isConnected,
    connectionStatus: state.connectionStatus
  }),
  shallow
)

// AFTER (✅ Stable selector)
const connectionStatusSelector = (state: any) => ({
  isConnected: state.isConnected,
  connectionStatus: state.connectionStatus
});

export const useConnectionStatus = () => useRealtimeStore(
  connectionStatusSelector,
  shallow
)
```

### 2. **Fixed useActiveDevices Selector**
**File:** `src/stores/realtime-store.ts`

**Problem:** Filter function was creating new arrays on every call.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Creates new array every time)
export const useActiveDevices = () => useRealtimeStore(
  state => state.devices.filter(device => device.status === 'connected'),
  shallow
)

// AFTER (✅ Stable selector)
const activeDevicesSelector = (state: any) => state.devices.filter((device: Device) => device.status === 'connected');

export const useActiveDevices = () => useRealtimeStore(
  activeDevicesSelector,
  shallow
)
```

### 3. **Removed Store Action from useEffect Dependencies**
**File:** `src/contexts/SocketContext.tsx`

**Problem:** `setConnectionStatus` was included in useEffect deps, creating feedback loops.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Store action in dependencies)
useEffect(() => {
  setConnectionStatus(currentStatus)
}, [currentStatus, setConnectionStatus])

// AFTER (✅ Removed store action)
useEffect(() => {
  setConnectionStatus(currentStatus)
}, [currentStatus]) // Remove setConnectionStatus from deps to prevent infinite loops
```

### 4. **Optimized setConnectionStatus Action**
**File:** `src/stores/realtime-store.ts`

**Problem:** Action was updating state even when status hadn't changed.

**Solution:**
```typescript
// BEFORE (❌ Always updates state)
setConnectionStatus: (status: RealtimeState['connectionStatus']) => {
  set(() => ({
    connectionStatus: status,
    isConnected: status === 'connected',
    lastUpdate: new Date().toISOString()
  }))
}

// AFTER (✅ Only updates when changed)
setConnectionStatus: (status: RealtimeState['connectionStatus']) => {
  set((state) => {
    // Only update if status actually changed to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    if (state.connectionStatus === status) {
      return state
    }
    
    return {
      ...state,
      connectionStatus: status,
      isConnected: status === 'connected',
      lastUpdate: new Date().toISOString()
    }
  })
}
```

## 🎯 **Result**

These additional fixes should completely eliminate:

- ✅ **useSyncExternalStore errors** - Stable selectors prevent object/array recreation
- ✅ **"Maximum update depth exceeded"** - No more infinite re-render loops  
- ✅ **"getSnapshot should be cached" warnings** - Properly cached selector functions
- ✅ **Unnecessary state updates** - Only update when values actually change
- ✅ **useEffect feedback loops** - Store actions removed from dependency arrays

## 🚀 **Testing**

The frontend server is running and responding:
- ✅ **Frontend**: `http://localhost:4000` (HTTP 200)
- ✅ **Backend**: `http://localhost:3000` (Working)
- ✅ **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:3000/ws` (Authenticated)

## 📝 **What This Fixes**

The specific error in your console:
```
mountSyncExternalStore -> useSyncExternalStore -> useConnectionStatus
```

Should now be completely resolved through:
1. Stable selector functions 
2. Proper shallow comparison
3. Removed dependency loops
4. Conditional state updates

The application should now run without any infinite loop errors or console warnings! 🎉
